## Instructions

The assignment grading is very simple, if you create something that looks like the two sample outputs (searching for "Chris" in the small images and "Mark" in the large images) you get full points! If you fail to handle the case where some pages have the text but no faces (with the Mark search) you can still pass the assignment, but I know you can do better!
